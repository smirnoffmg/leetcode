# 3731. Find Missing Elements

- Difficulty: easy

- Topics: Array, Hash Table, Sorting
- Acceptance: 87.3%

## Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of **unique** integers.

Originally, `nums` contained **every integer** within a certain range. However, some integers might have gone **missing**
from the array.

The **smallest** and **largest** integers of the original range are still present in `nums`.

Return a **sorted** list of all the missing integers in this range. If no integers are missing, return an **empty** list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,2,5]

**Output:** [3]

**Explanation:**

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be `[1,2,3,4,5]`. Among these, only 3 is missing.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [7,8,6,9]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

The smallest integer is 6 and the largest is 9, so the full range is `[6,7,8,9]`. All integers are already present, so no integer is missing.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [5,1]

**Output:** [2,3,4]

**Explanation:**

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be `[1,2,3,4,5]`. The missing integers are 2, 3, and 4.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Hints

<details><summary>Hint 1</summary>

First, find the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

<details><summary>Hint 2</summary>

Then, iterate over all the integers in the range `[min, max]` and check if they are in the array.

<details><summary>Hint 3</summary>

If not, add them to the array, and return the sorted array at the end.
